# airflow-simulator

Quick and dirty project to create an airflow heat or fluid animation/diagram by painting/combing/dragging/raking a vector-field.

Based off of Dean Alex's JavaScript 2D Fluid / Turbulence Sim, http://neuroid.co.uk/lab/fluid/

Good for:

Airflow, wind (temperature/heat)
Water, fluid
If you want to use this, probably best to clone this locally and start adjusting the image and configuration there instead of using the live version.
